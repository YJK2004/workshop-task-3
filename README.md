# workshop-task-3: IMAGES

URL: https://yjk2004.github.io/3/

## notes
- I thought a lot about what images am I going to use, then I realised that my favourite Korean boy band just released their new album.
- I wanted to give viewers a clear steps to enjoy my sketches, so I did some research about 'text disappears when I clidk' for p5js: https://editor.p5js.org/amcc/sketches/WQbTQWFyL


## error
- My sketches works in Visual Studio Code but it was not showing up when I publish the page. It kept coming up with text saying "loading...", through some trial and error I finally worked it out.
